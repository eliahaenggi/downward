# Master's Thesis: Efficient Implementation of h2 in the Fast Downward Planning System

This repository contains the code developed as part of my Master's thesis titled "Efficient Implementation of h2 in the Fast Downward Planning System". The thesis explores the computation and optimization of the h2 heuristic within the Fast Downward planner.

## Repository Overview

This project is based on a fork of Fast Downward (revision dated 24.11.2024). The following sections describe the main components and their locations in the codebase.

## h2 Heuristic Optimization

**Path**: downward/src/heuristics/htwo_heuristic

This module includes the optimized implementation of the h2 heuristic, as described in Chapter 4 of the thesis. The original (unoptimized) implementation is still available in downward/src/heuristics/hm_heuristic.

An alternative version using binary operators can be found on the "binary_operators" branch within the same file.

**Usage**:
./fast-downward.py [DOMAIN_FILE] [PROBLEM_FILE] --search "astar(h2())"

## Pi^m Compilation and hmax Heuristic

- Task compilation: downward/src/tasks/pi_m_compiled_task
- Heuristic extension: downward/src/heuristics/hmax_heuristic

These modules implement the Pi^m compilation strategy, which evaluates h2 by computing hmax(Pi^2), as described in Chapter 6. The compilation transforms a SAS+ task into a Pi^2 STRIPS task. The transformation is optional and activated via a configuration parameter.

**Usage**:
./fast-downward.py [DOMAIN_FILE] [PROBLEM_FILE] --search "astar(hmax(pi_m_compilation=true))"

---

## Duality-Based h2: Regression Simulation

- Task transformation: downward/src/tasks/dual_task
- Heuristic wrapper: downward/src/heuristics/dual_htwo_heuristic

These modules implement the regression simulation using STRIPS duality. The dual_htwo_heuristic class builds on the optimized h2 heuristic to compute h2(Pi^d), as discussed in Chapter 7.

Note: Heuristic values differ from those of the standard h2 heuristic due to the transformation of the task.

**Usage**:
./fast-downward.py [DOMAIN_FILE] [PROBLEM_FILE] --search "astar(dualh2())"

## Experimental Setup

- Experiment scripts: downward/experiments/hm/v1.py
- Dependencies: downward/experiments/hm/requirements.txt

This directory contains all experimental scripts and setup. The main script v1.py runs experiments using Downward Lab, a framework for managing and analyzing planning experiments.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Fast Downward (base fork)
- Downward Lab (for experiments)
- Optional: Machetli (for debugging or introspection)

## Acknowledgements

This thesis was conducted at the University of Basel, supervised by Clemens BÃ¼chner and examined by Prof. Malte Helmert. Experiments were executed on the sciCORE cluster. Special thanks go to the teams behind Fast Downward, Downward Lab, and Machetli for their tools and support.
